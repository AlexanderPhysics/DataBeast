<p>My name is Alexander. I am a Data Scientist based on out Berkeley, CA. My industry experience includes Wine.com and NASA Ames Research Center. What excites me most about Data Science is leveraging machine learning and big data tech to build deployable, data-driven products that bring tangible value to people's lives. This page briefly explores some of the projects that I store in the DataBeastrepo. </p>

<h3>
<a id="winecom" class="anchor" href="#winecom" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wine.com</h3>

<p>I built a scalable, automated wine recommendation system using Spark. The recommender provides users with personalized wines, presented by varietals. This project brought together a range of skills and technologies, include Exploratory Data Analysis, machine learning, and distributed computing. My favorite part of this project was overcoming the challenge of sparse ratings. Only 2.5% of Wine.com's users rate wines, so I feature engineered the purchase data to reflect user sentiment by creating a novel transformation that behaves like a statistical Z-score.  </p>

<a id="nasa" class="anchor" href="#nasa" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NASA</h3>

<p>I engineered a feature extract pipeline for satellite images: images go in, data tables come out. These images had valuable information about sunspots, including their changing positions over time and magnetic properties. The project leveraged Skimage for object detection and NASA's Pleaides supercomputer for cloud cluster computing. This data will empower Heliophysicist to design more sophisticated models of the solar cycle. The solar cycle has a direct impact on Earth's satellite performance and stability as well as Earth's climate. </p>

<h3>
<a id="deep-learning" class="anchor" href="#deep-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deep Learning</h3>

<p>I've also designed and coded deep learning networks using the Theano neural-network library in Python. I've used deep learning to build image classifiers, predict the value of stocks into the future, and understand how convex and non-convex optimization algorithms work, including gradient descent and particle scatter. </p>

<h3>
<a id="big-data-engineering" class="anchor" href="#big-data-engineering" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Big Data Engineering</h3>

<p>I've used Spark, SparkSQL, SparkStreaming, Kafka, HBase, and Lambda Architecture to engineer an ETL pipeline. This pipeline accepts unstructured data, then Kafka feeds identical copies of the data into a batch and speed layer. This ensure that the user can have real-time, up-to-the second data for their SQL queries. This project brought together so many different big data technologies and gave me a valuable understanding of how to design a robust data infrastructure. </p>

<h3>
<a id="sentiment-analysis" class="anchor" href="#sentiment-analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sentiment Analysis</h3>

<p>Using Sklearn's machine learning library and NLTK's NLP library, I trained several models to identify user sentiment from IMDB movie reviews. After exploring models and text vectorizations, I created a machine learning ensemble using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes, and the text was vectorized into a bag-of-words representation. I am currently experimenting on how to improve on this work by using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec neural networks. </p>
