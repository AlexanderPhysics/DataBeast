# Content-Based Recommender for New York Times Articles 

In this notebook, you will create a content based recommender for New York Times articles. This recommender is an example of a very simple data product. You will follow the same proceedure outlined in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/data-lab/how-we-used-data-to-suggest-tags-for-your-story-a120076d0bb6#.4vu7uby9z) in order to build your very own content based recommender.

However, we will not be recommending tags. Instead we'll be recommending new articles that a user should read based on the article that they are currently reading.
