Though yen-denominated loans are not covered by the sanctions, Japanese banks are leery of lending in Russia amid concern over the U.S. reaction, the Nikkei said.\\nThe loan is part of an eight-point economic cooperation plan presented to Russian President Vladimir Putin by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in May as part of a \"new approach\" to the decade-long dispute.\\nJBIC has started offering ruble-denominated financing this month. To shore up the lender\\'s capital, the Ministry of Finance earmarked 109 billion yen in investment in JBIC in the recently approved second supplementary budget for fiscal 2016, the Nikkei said.\\nAbe is betting that close ties to Putin, as well as Russia\\'s economic woes and regional concerns about China\\'s rise will help him make progress in a decades-old territorial row when they meet in December.\\nThe dispute over the four islands north of Japan\\'s Hokkaido has prevented Tokyo and Moscow signing a peace treaty formally ending the war they fought with each other in World War Two.\\n(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Robert Birsel)'"

    "Unlike BoW, Tf-Idf identifies the importance of words not merely by text frequency, but also by the inverse document frequency. So, for example, if a word like \"Obama\" only appears a few times in an article (like the word \"he\" or \"a\" or \"the\" which don't convey much information) but appears in several different articles then it would be given a higher weight. Which makes senses because \"Obama\" isn't a stop word nor is it mention without good reason (i.e. it's highly relevant to the article's topic). "
