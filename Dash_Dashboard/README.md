This is a prototype analytical dashboard for solar energy consumers. 

This is our scenario: imagine that one of Google's locations (there are many in the USA) has 4 buildings, each with solar panel installations. They want to keep track of 3 very importannt trends: 

1. Energy Consumption by each building
2. Energy Production by each building
3. Energy cost/profit by each building

The numbers will be tracked monthly. The cost is the energy bill for each building, so that means that the building has consumed more energy than its solar panels produced. The profit is the money made by selling excess energy back to the energy grid. In the end, we will have one years worth of data for each building.
