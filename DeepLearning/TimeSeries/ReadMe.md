These two IPython Notebooks contain Deep Learning Networks trained on time series data. 
The data contains monthly mean sunspots collected over several hundred years from the Royal Solar Observatory in Belgium.

The LSTM_Sunspots notebook contains an implementation of a Long and Short Term Memory Deep Network and a Fully Connected
Feed-Forward Network. 

The Stacked_Networks_Sunspots notebook stacks these two Deep Networks.
