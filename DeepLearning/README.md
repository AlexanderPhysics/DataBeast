# Deep Learning

I designed and coded deep learning networks using the Theano neural-network library in Python. I've used deep learning to 
build [image classifiers](https://github.com/AlexanderPhysics/DataBeast/blob/master/DeepLearning/ImageRecognition/ImageRecogniton_CNN.ipynb), [predict the appearnce of sunspots 6 months into the future](https://github.com/AlexanderPhysics/DataBeast/blob/master/DeepLearning/TimeSeries/Long_Short_Term_Memory_(LSTM).ipynb), and to better understand how convex and non-convex optimization algorithms work, including [gradient descent](https://github.com/AlexanderPhysics/DataBeast/blob/master/DeepLearning/Optimization/High_Performance_Gradient_Descent.ipynb) and [particle swarm](https://github.com/AlexanderPhysics/DataBeast/blob/master/DeepLearning/Optimization/Global_Optimization.ipynb).
