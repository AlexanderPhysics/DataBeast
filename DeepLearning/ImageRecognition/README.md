#Image Recognition 

The IPython Notebook titled ImageRecognition_CNN has two implementations of Convolutional Neuro-Nets.
The first CNN is trained on the MNist data set which contains black and white images. 
The second CNN is trained on the CIFAR data set wich contains color images. 
Both data sets have ten classifications. 
Methods for regularization are also discussed and used.
